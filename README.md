Known issues and warnings

- Google places deprecation warnings
- An prop type warning when opening and closing the filter options menu. This is due to the ref I added for the filter button that allows the menu to close when the menu is open.

Known limitations

- When moving within the map, the location is hard coded to the all trails latitude and longitude headquarters. Ideally, we're updating the bounds of the map and when we search, we only search the bounds of the current map.

What I would do different or fix with more time

- Feature: Filter hearted restaurants to the top
- Feature: Allow clearing the search results on the map
- Feature: If map moves, re-search area button pops up at the bottom (or top)
- Feature: More filter options
